Abstract:
Leaking tank problems are common applications of ordinary differential equations in Civil Engineering. This machine problem aims to determine the time required to drain a water-filled tank using analytical, Euler’s, midpoint, and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods wherein three different step sizes (0.1, 0.01, 0.001) were given. The time vs. height graph was plotted for each of the methods and step sizes and was compared with that of the analytical method. On the other hand, Springs, having multiple important roles in our community, should be studied and understood in order for it to be truly appreciated. This other part of the machine problem tackles the computation of the displacement over time of the two spring-masses along with its natural frequencies and mode shapes. Through the use of the 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method for Ordinary Differential Equations and the Shifted-Inverse Power Method, the group was able to accurately determine the characteristics of the coupled spring-mass system. The resulting graphed displacement-time values of the system resulted in a sinusoidal wave.
